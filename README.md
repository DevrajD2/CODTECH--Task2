# Objective:
To explore unsupervised learning techniques by performing a comprehensive analysis on a dataset, specifically focusing on different clustering algorithms. The goal is to understand the differences between the clustering techniques, assess their performance on the dataset.

# Key Activities 
• Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values. 
• Data Visualization: Creating Visualization to understand data distribution trends and relationships.
• Hierarchical Clustering: To group similar objects based on distance metrics.
• K-Means Clustering: To partition data points into a pre-defined number of clusters (k), where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean

# Technology Used 
• Python 
• Pandas 
• Matplotlib 
• NumPy 
• Scikit-Learn
