# Overview of the Project

# Project: Library Management System with Data Science

![P2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccabe18a-4baf-4968-bfe8-6604eb7f0fc7)

# Objective:
To explore unsupervised learning techniques by performing a comprehensive analysis on a dataset, specifically focusing on different clustering algorithms. The goal is to understand the differences between the clustering techniques, assess their performance on the dataset, and gain insights into the underlying structure of the data.

# Key Activities 
• Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values. 
• Data Visualization: Creating Visualization to understand data distribution trends and relationships.
• Hierarchical Clustering: To group similar objects based on distance metrics.
• K-Means Clustering: To partition data points into a pre-defined number of clusters (k), where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean
• Clustering Results: Evaluation of silhouette score.

# Technology Used 
• Python 
• Pandas 
• Matplotlib 
• NumPy 
• Scikit-Learn
